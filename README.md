# RecursionError in Python

This repository demonstrates a common Python error: RecursionError.  A RecursionError is raised when the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.  This often happens when a recursive function does not have a proper base case or the base case is not reached within the allowed recursion limit. 

The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a solution using iteration.
